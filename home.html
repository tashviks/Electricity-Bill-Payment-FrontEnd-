  <p>Electricity consumption remains a significant environmental concern around the world. We still generate most of the electricity consumed from fossil fuel; oil, natural gas, and coal. We source the fuel for electricity generated this way below the ground surface which usually requires collection using drilling and mining.</p>

  <p>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), coal-fired power plants were the most significant contributor to emissions growth in 2018. Coal-fired electricity generation accounts for 30% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

  <h3 align="left">Electricity is cleaner but saving energy still helps the environment</h3>

  <p>Saving energy remains important despite countries like the UK has made huge strides toward cleaner electricity.</p>

  <p>Over 40% of electricity generation in the UK came from renewable sources in December 2020. At the same time, the US tallies a more modest, yet improving, 20%.</p>

  <p>However, non-renewable power plants still fire up regularly to meet peaks in demand. Especially in colder months to heat our homes, or when very hot, to provide energy for the ubiquitous air conditioner in warmer climes. </p>

  <p>When we conserve energy at home, we can all play a small yet valuable role in helping to reduce the need for electricity generation. And for each energy-saving we make in the home,  we help reduce demand, reducing polluting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

  <h2>Energy Saving Tips for the Home</h2>

  <h3 align="left">1. Watch out for energy-draining appliances</h3>
  <p>Did you know: Your electronic appliances use as much as 75% of their electricity consumption when switched off?</p>
  <p>A simple tour of your home will likely prove you have at least several plugged-in items you’re not using. For example, electrical items on standby, such as TV’s, computers and video games consoles. Many of these appliances draw a small amount of electricity whilst waiting for use. </p>
  <h4 align="left">Switch off when not in use to save electricity & conserve energy </h4>
  <p>You can recognise electrical appliances drawing electricity if they have a standby setting or a little light glowing while waiting for use. When not using them for a while, turn them off at the wall to conserve energy.</p>
  <p>Whereas the electricity they consume might seem small, it all adds up over a longer period on your electric bill. Keep an eye out, especially for older appliances that might be less energy efficient. </p>

  <h3 align="left">2. Smart power strips help to manage usage the smart way</h3>
  <p>Whereas unplugging and switching off appliances at the wall will do the trick, another task in our busy days can easily slip the mind. To help keep those energy-hungry appliances in check, you’ll find it easier to conserve energy using smart power strips.</p>
  <p>A smart power strip deals with the problem of not in use electronics draining energy unnecessarily. With a power strip, you can configure them to shut off electricity to appliances when not in use. Alternatively, some models enable you to save electricity costs by setting timers to turn off the supply when you’re at work or asleep.</p>

  <h3 align="left">3. Use large appliances together to reduce energy use</h3>
  <p>Whereas your modern washing machine and dryer may be marked energy-efficient, even energy efficient appliances still consume a lot of electricity with each use.</p>

  <p>To conserve electricity as much as possible, pool your laundry together (as a family or roommates) and do full loads all at once. As a result, you cut down on the number of times you end up using the washer every week. If it helps, think about how much money you’re throwing away with each wash of an item or two. </p>

  <h3 align="left">4. Cold wash when you can - its just as good!</h3>
  <p>Further, treat the warm wash as optional for when you really need it. Not heating water every time you wash clothes makes for one of those super easy ways to save energy. With all the bells and whistles of modern washers and detergent designed for cold washes, you’ll quickly find you can have spotless clothes using cold water. </p>

  <h3 align="left">5. Dry your clothes and dishes naturally</h3>
  <p>You can also cut out dryer use to save energy by drying your clothes in the sun (if you live in a home that allows for it, that is). If you can’t avoid the dryer, use a lower setting, even if drying might take more time.</p>

  <p>If you use a dishwasher, ditch the heated drying cycle by drying with a napkin. You could also leave the dishwasher door open and allow for air drying to save money on the heat cycle. It's perfectly OK to let dishes air dry they'll be just as hygienic.
